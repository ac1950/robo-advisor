"Use GitHub Desktop software or the command-line to download or "clone" this repository onto your computer. Choose a familiar download location like the Desktop" 


"After cloning the repo, navigate there from the command-line:"

### Security Requirements
"This program utlizes the AlphaVantage API (https://www.alphavantage.co/)"
"This API should not be included within the sourcecode. Instead, you should set an environment variable called ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY, and your program should read the API Key from this environment variable at run-time."
"To do this create a file called ".env" and place the following inside with your specific API key:"
` ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY = "abc123" `

"This code should also contain a file called ".gitignore" which will prevent the ".env" file to be read. If this file is not in the repository that you just cloned, create a file called ".gitignore" and place the following contents inside: "
`# .gitignore`
`      `
`# ignore secret environment variable values in the ".env" file:`
`.env `
